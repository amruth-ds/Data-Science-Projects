Regression:Sales of items in shops
1. How to divide numerical and categorical columns in a data frame
2. Cleaning outliers
3. Imputing Missing values 
4.  I have tried to impute missing values by creating a model as the column with missing values is a categorical column and replacing missiing values with mode is biasing toward the values which is more in count.So created a naive bias model to predict the missing values of that column 'Outlet_Size'
5. Visualizing the box plots of all columns
6. Skewness Test and Log Transformation to remove skewness
7. Residual plot visualization
8. Backward elimination for feature selection
9. Validation performance with regularization techniques
10. Model trained using Linear Regression Algorithm.
